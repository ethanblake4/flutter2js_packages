/// A material design "flat button".
///
/// A flat button is a section printed on a [Material] widget that reacts to
/// touches by filling with color.
///
/// Use flat buttons on toolbars, in dialogs, or inline with other content but
/// offset from that content with padding so that the button's presence is
/// obvious. Flat buttons intentionally do not have visible borders and must
/// therefore rely on their position relative to other content for context. In
/// dialogs and cards, they should be grouped together in one of the bottom
/// corners. Avoid using flat buttons where they would blend in with other
/// content, for example in the middle of lists.
///
/// Material design flat buttons have an all-caps label, some internal padding,
/// and some defined dimensions. To have a part of your application be
/// interactive, with ink splashes, without also committing to these stylistic
/// choices, consider using [InkWell] instead.
///
/// If the [onPressed] callback is null, then the button will be disabled,
/// will not react to touch, and will be colored as specified by
/// the [disabledColor] property instead of the [color] property. If you are
/// trying to change the button's [color] and it is not having any effect, check
/// that you are passing a non-null [onPressed] handler.
///
/// Requires one of its ancestors to be a [Material] widget.
///
/// Flat buttons will expand to fit the child widget, if necessary.
///
/// ## Troubleshooting
///
/// ### Why does my button not have splash effects?
///
/// If you place a [FlatButton] on top of an [Image], [Container],
/// [DecoratedBox], or some other widget that draws an opaque background between
/// the [FlatButton] and its ancestor [Material], the splashes will not be
/// visible. This is because ink splashes draw in the [Material] itself, as if
/// the ink was spreading inside the material.
///
/// The [Ink] widget can be used as a replacement for [Image], [Container], or
/// [DecoratedBox] to ensure that the image or decoration also paints in the
/// [Material] itself, below the ink.
///
/// If this is not possible for some reason, e.g. because you are using an
/// opaque [CustomPaint] widget, alternatively consider using a second
/// [Material] above the opaque widget but below the [FlatButton] (as an
/// ancestor to the button). The [MaterialType.transparency] material kind can
/// be used for this purpose.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [RaisedButton], which is a button that hovers above the containing
///    material.
///  * [DropdownButton], which offers the user a choice of a number of options.
///  * [SimpleDialogOption], which is used in [SimpleDialog]s.
///  * [IconButton], to create buttons that just contain icons.
///  * [InkWell], which implements the ink splash part of a flat button.
///  * <https://material.google.com/components/buttons.html>
